## ⚡ AGENT QUICK START

**Your job**: Help with SRT Clarity Search - a Next.js application that provides AI-powered search similar to Perplexity.ai, integrated with the platform's vLLM inference service.

**Shaun's top rule**: No workarounds, no temporary fixes, complete solutions only.

**Where to start**:
1. Read "Project Overview" below
2. Understand vLLM integration (uses internal cluster service)
3. Reference deployment patterns as needed
4. Use ChromaDB for platform integration questions

---

## 📚 PLATFORM INTEGRATION (ChromaDB Knowledge Base)

**When working in this submodule**, you cannot access the parent srt-hq-k8s repository files. Use ChromaDB to query platform capabilities and integration patterns.

**Collection**: `srt-hq-k8s-platform-guide` (43 docs, updated 2025-11-11)

**Why This Matters for SRT Clarity Search**:
This application is deployed on the SRT-HQ Kubernetes platform and integrates with:
- **vLLM Inference Service**: Uses internal K8s service for AI completions
- **Platform Ingress**: SSL certificate automation via Let's Encrypt DNS-01
- **Platform Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards
- **Platform Networking**: ClusterIP services and ingress routing

**Query When You Need**:
- Platform architecture and three-tier taxonomy
- vLLM inference service endpoints and configuration
- Ingress and SSL certificate patterns
- Platform service discovery and networking
- Monitoring and logging integration

**Example Queries**:
```
"What is the srt-hq-k8s platform architecture?"
"How do I connect to the vLLM inference service from within the cluster?"
"What is the vLLM service endpoint URL?"
"How does ingress and SSL work on the platform?"
"How do I integrate with platform monitoring?"
```

**When NOT to Query**:
- ❌ Next.js development (use Next.js docs)
- ❌ Application logic (see README.md)
- ❌ Docker build process (use build-and-push.ps1)
- ❌ OpenAI SDK usage (use OpenAI docs)

## 📍 PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Application Type**: AI-powered search engine (Perplexity.ai clone)
**Tech Stack**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
**Build System**: Next.js built-in (webpack under the hood)
**Package Manager**: npm
**Production**: Node.js server (port 3000)

**Key Features**:
- AI-powered web search with contextual answers
- Google search scraping for relevant sources
- Webpage content extraction and parsing
- Streaming AI responses (SSE/streaming API)
- Clean, modern UI with Tabler icons
- Integration with vLLM inference (local, self-hosted)

**How It Works**:
1. User enters search query
2. App scrapes Google for relevant webpages
3. Parses webpages for text content
4. Builds prompt using query + webpage text
5. Calls vLLM API (OpenAI-compatible) for answer generation
6. Streams answer back to user with source citations

## 🚀 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server (HMR enabled)
npm run dev
# Access: http://localhost:3000

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
# Access: http://localhost:3000
```

**Note**: In local development, you'll need to configure the inference URL in `types/index.ts`:
- Use `INFERENCE_URL = "http://localhost:5000/v1/chat/completions"` for local vLLM
- Or use the public URL: `https://vllm.lab.hq.solidrust.net/v1/chat/completions`

### Docker Testing

```bash
# Build image locally
.\build-and-push.ps1

# Test image
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 suparious/srt-clarity-search:latest

## 🏗️ BUILD PROCESS

### Multi-Stage Docker Build

**Stage 1: Dependencies** (node:24-alpine)
1. Copy package files
2. Install production dependencies with `npm ci`

**Stage 2: Builder** (node:24-alpine)
1. Copy dependencies from stage 1
2. Copy application source
3. Build Next.js app with `npm run build`

**Stage 3: Production** (node:24-alpine)
1. Copy built application from builder
2. Create non-root user (nextjs:1001)
3. Configure environment variables
4. Expose port 3000
5. Run Next.js production server

**Build Time**: ~3-7 minutes
**Image Size**: ~200-300 MB (Node.js + Next.js app)

---

## 🌐 NETWORKING

**Ingress Configuration**:
- Host: `clarity.lab.hq.solidrust.net`
- TLS: Let's Encrypt DNS-01 (automatic via cert-manager)
- Certificate Secret: `srt-clarity-search-tls`
- Ingress Class: `nginx`
- SSL Redirect: Enabled
- Proxy Timeouts: 300s (for streaming responses)

**Service**:
- Type: ClusterIP
- Port: 80 (HTTP)
- Target Port: 3000 (Next.js container)

**vLLM Integration**:
- Internal Service: `vllm-inference.vllm-inference.svc.cluster.local:8000`
- API Endpoint: `/v1/chat/completions` (OpenAI-compatible)
- Authentication: Bearer token (passed from client)
- Model: Configured in vLLM deployment (typically Meta-Llama or similar)

**Access**:
- Production: `https://clarity.lab.hq.solidrust.net`
- Redirects HTTP → HTTPS automatically

---

## 📊 RESOURCE ALLOCATION

**Deployment**:
- Replicas: 2 (high availability)
- Strategy: RollingUpdate

**Container Resources**:
- **Requests**: 200m CPU, 256Mi memory
- **Limits**: 1000m CPU, 512Mi memory

**Probes**:
- **Liveness**: HTTP GET / every 30s (after 15s initial delay)
- **Readiness**: HTTP GET / every 10s (after 10s initial delay)

**Rationale**: Next.js with API routes needs more resources than static SPA, but still modest for a web app

---

## 🔍 VALIDATION

### After Deployment

```bash
# 1. Check pods are running
kubectl get pods -n srt-clarity-search
# Expected: 2/2 pods Running

# 2. Check service
kubectl get svc -n srt-clarity-search
# Expected: ClusterIP service on port 80

# 3. Check ingress
kubectl get ingress -n srt-clarity-search
# Expected: clarity.lab.hq.solidrust.net with ADDRESS

# 4. Check certificate
kubectl get certificate -n srt-clarity-search
# Expected: READY=True

# 5. Check ConfigMap
kubectl get configmap -n srt-clarity-search
# Expected: srt-clarity-search-config with vLLM URLs

# 6. Test application
curl -k https://clarity.lab.hq.solidrust.net
# Expected: HTML response with search interface

# 7. Test vLLM connectivity (from pod)
kubectl exec -it -n srt-clarity-search <pod-name> -- \
  wget -O- http://vllm-inference.vllm-inference.svc.cluster.local:8000/v1/models
# Expected: JSON response with available models

# 8. Browser test
# Open https://clarity.lab.hq.solidrust.net
# Expected: Green padlock, app loads, search works with AI responses
```

## 💡 KEY DECISIONS

### Why Next.js (not pure React)?
- Need server-side API routes for web scraping
- Better SEO capabilities (if needed in future)
- Built-in API route handling
- Streaming support for AI responses

### Why Node.js runtime (not static export)?
- Application uses API routes (`/api/answer`, `/api/sources`)
- Web scraping requires server-side execution
- Streaming responses need server runtime
- Cannot be compiled to static HTML

### Why vLLM integration?
- Self-hosted inference = $0 per token (vs $0.01-0.05 per 1K tokens)
- Platform already has vLLM deployed with GPU acceleration
- OpenAI-compatible API = minimal code changes
- Complete control over models and performance

### Why ConfigMap for vLLM URLs?
- Easy to update without rebuilding images
- Different URLs for internal vs external access
- Flexibility to switch endpoints if needed
- Following platform patterns

### Why 2 replicas?
- High availability
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Load distribution
- Better than 1 (no HA) or 3+ (overkill for this workload)

### Why ClusterIP service?
- No external LoadBalancer needed
- Traffic comes through Ingress only
- Standard pattern for web apps on this platform
